# The Dial-in Project

The Dial-in project is a simple video-game-alike simulation for learning how to dial in coffee. If you'd like to know more about coffee, check the wiki link :

## List of Tasks (Software Engineering)
---
## Task 1 : Use and Understand GIT
### Task Description : Use and understand GIT, and be able to apply the basic commands. Can you experiment with time travelling or branches/merges? E.g. add some screenshots, add a paragraph text or show by reference/link into the commits, that you applied all the commands.


## Task 2 : UML
### Task Description : at least 3 big different diagrams. "big" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all the tools to view them! For example, these diagrams are a good idea: Use-Case, Component D, Class D, and Activity Diagram.

## Task 3 : REQUIREMENTS
### Task Description : Create 5-10 good requirements for your project. Then put them into a simple tool (like Airtable, Notion or Trello) and a professional tool (like Monday, Jira, Doors, ObjectIF, Xebrio, etc.) Instead of the professional version, you can also build a tool yourself; e.g. with AI! If you have used AI / LLMs here, briefly describe where and how! However, it is more important here that some / many attributes are used!

## Task 4 : ANALYSIS
### Task Description : A) Think about your checklist (on an extra A4 page) from all the points of the ‘ANA - Analysis’ learning unit, with the points that you consider relevant for your project (e.g. 10-15 instead of 30 on the overall picture) B) Carry out an analysis of your semester project / your favourite project. Or have a start-up idea and would like to hand in the start-up analysis as part of a large documentary! There should be at least 2 pages. Take the 10-15 points from the checklist (with e.g. 1-2 paragraphs per point). Assume that you will soon have a fishing rod for the start-up chapter. If you are successful, you would receive a lot of ‘money’ in order to be allowed to design and implement it later. So get your start-up off to a successful start! The use of large language models is explicitly encouraged here! However, don't try to solve everything with one prompt and then submit 10 pages: get specific help!Provide the prompts in brackets that have helped you to improve or structure something here! Please find the sweet spot between your own work/testing and content generation in order to learn something yourself throughout the entire process!

## Task 5 : DDD
### Task Description : (A) Do an Event-Storming to find your Domains! If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 100 Mio € from Edlich-Investment!) (B). Drop your Domains into a Core Domain Chart (C) and indicate the Relations = Mappings (! see MIRO examples again) between the Domains in a new diagram!

## Task 6 : METRICS
### Task Description : at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non-trivial metrics are also fine. Run the tools, document the output with screenshots, and explain what these Metrics or e.g. style errors mean!

## Task 7 : CLEAN CODE DEVELOPMENT
### Task Description : A) At least 5 points you can show me with an explanation of why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved & B) >>10 points on your personal CCD cheat sheet. E.g. a PDF.

## Task 8 : REFACTORING
### Task Description : Show me two (non-trivial) Refactoring Examples of your code! Showing the original content and the refactored code! Explain what happened, why and how it has improved! Again: do not send me pure AI work!

## Task 9 : BUILD
### Task Description : Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. (it could also be disconnected from the project just to learn a build tool!) => to be merged with 7!

## Task 10 : CONTINOUS DELIVERY
### Task Description : show me your pipeline using e.g. Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. E.g. you can also use Jenkins Pipelining or BlueOcean, etc. But at least insert more than 2 script calls as done in the lecture! (e.g. also call Ant or Gradle or something else).

## Task 11 : UNIT TESTS
### Task Description : Integrate some nice UNIT TESTS in your Code to be integrated into the Build!

## Task 12 : IDE 
### Task Description : Use a good IDE and get fluent with it: e.g. VSCode, IntelliJ. What are your favourite key shortcuts?!

## Task 13 : AI Coding
### Task Description : Set Up an AI-coding environment on your computer like ZED, Aider, free Cursor / Windsurf, GitHub Copilot programs, etc. (some have free tiers). Show your steps and personal experiences! 

## Task 14 : FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
### Task Description : 14. prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:, only final data structures, (mostly) side-effect-free functions, the use of higher-order functions, functions as parameters and return values, use closures / anonymous functions. You can also do it outside of your project. Even in other languages such as F#, Clojure, Julia, etc.
