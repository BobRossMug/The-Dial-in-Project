This project is a learning tool to understand how to extract espresso,

the initial scope was to make different beans and metrics but the final (at least for the class) is only the metrics of one type of
bean, a small lot coffee from Santa Monica, link below is to the roaster :

In sumamry the way the data was acquired was the following :

I had 90 shots of double espresso

I wrote metrics down, such as :

-grind size (Eureka Dolce Vita with ARO dial, 0 to 165 scope on the micrometric system)

-grind dose (by grams)

-extraction length (seconds)

-final cup size (grams)

-taste optimisation (this was a grading system of 1 to 10, in comparison to all previous shots, and desired flavours foretold by the roaster)


Everything else about the proeject is in the Wiki!
