This project is a learning tool to understand how to extract espresso,

So, before we get into the full document, what the hell am I talking about? What is the "dialing in" and "espresso extraction yields" and all those word dump mumbo jumbo?

Here is my understanding as a student of coffee for the past 12 years. 
-Espresso is a traditional base drink, typically made from finely ground 7 to 12 (for a single) and 14 to 22 (for a double) grams of fresh coffee. The end result is a drink that is roughly double the ratio of coffee in grams of water/coffee extracted, a 2.0 ratio, with a 10% +- based on prefernce. So this would be in our case, 18 grams in, 36 out. Though some of the shots are within the 10% +- parameter for taste adjustments as well as user error. But for this drink, 1.8 to 2.2 in ratio is acceptable.

-When extracted properly, a well roasted espresso bean (which is an argument equivalent to "curly brackets one line down or on the init" in the coffee circles) will display a wide range of flavours depending on the roast profile, country of origin, type of bean, freshness, grinder model (with its range of variables, motor RPM, blade geometry, blade size, bean engagement type and a lot more). What you see in a supermarket brand coffee with tasting profiles is usually a bit dodgy, but a good roaster with good beans with its flavour profiles usually give you a range of flavours on appropriately extracted espresso. It's more of a "trust the process and you'll know when you get there" sort of thing. 

-Most of the magic happens in roasting, depending on a wide range of parameters a roaster will make a specific profile of roast for beans and optimise it from there on. A fair amount of coffee is wasted in this process.

-following that, on typically a random eureka machine, a mazzer if you are made of money or a mahlk√∂nig if you are a hipster, certain profiles are indicated. In the case of the beasn I am using, the flavour profile was created using a Erueka Mythos 75. First baseline cupping, then v60 optimization, then espresso based roast + about a kilo of beans worth of extractions indicated as a result the following tastes to be expected :  

COCONUT!

this is highly unusual for any coffee, but this one is an anaerobic coconut fermentation so that kinda explains the taste. The rest are minor notes. If you want to try some of this coffee I can ship you a sample, just send me a mail with your address and your coffee situation (do you brew at home? What kinda brews? Do you have a grinder? etc.)

But as an end result, we have coffee. We have flavour profiles, and we have the biggest challenge of a starter home barista, diailing in espresso without wasting coffee. These beans get expensive! This batch is 100 euros per 500 gramns! And here comes in "The Dial-in project". It helps users try out dialing in different beans and see how these metrics interact with each other. That, is the idea.

the initial scope was to make different beans and metrics but the final (at least for the class) is only the metrics of one type of bean, a small lot coffee from Santa Monica, link below is to the roaster :

In sumamry the way the data was acquired was the following :

I had 90 shots of double espresso

I wrote metrics down, such as :

-grind size (Eureka Dolce Vita with ARO dial, 0 to 165 scope on the micrometric system)

-grind dose (by grams)

-extraction length (seconds)

-final cup size (grams)

-taste optimisation (this was a grading system of 1 to 10, in comparison to all previous shots, and desired flavours foretold by the roaster)
